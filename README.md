# LabII Codes
 These are the data analysis codes of the LabII course of my bachelor's degree in physics. At the moment there is a folder for each experience. The codes are used to fit data to get the parameter of the physics laws to test. The programming language that I used is C++ and ROOT CERN is required. You can install ROOT library by ROOT CERN sites or by homebrew, after installed Homebrew write on the terminal -Brew Install root.
